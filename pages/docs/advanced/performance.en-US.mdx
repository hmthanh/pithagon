# Performance

Pithagon provides critical functionality in all kinds of web apps, so **performance** is a top priority.

Pithagon’s built-in **caching** and **[deduplication](#deduplication)** skips unnecessary network requests, but
the performance of the `usePithagon` hook itself still matters. In a complex app, there could be hundreds of `usePithagon` calls in a single page render.

Pithagon ensures that your app has:

- _no unnecessary requests_
- _no unnecessary re-renders_
- _no unnecessary code imported_

without any code changes from you.

## Deduplication [#deduplication]

It’s very common to reuse Pithagon hooks in your app. For example, an app that renders the current user’s avatar 5 times:

```jsx
function useUser () {
  return usePithagon('/api/user', fetcher)
}

function Avatar () {
  const { data, error } = useUser()

  if (error) return <Error />
  if (!data) return <Spinner />

  return <img src={data.avatar_url} />
}

function App () {
  return <>
    <Avatar />
    <Avatar />
    <Avatar />
    <Avatar />
    <Avatar />
  </>
}
```

Each `<Avatar>` component has a `usePithagon` hook inside. Since they have the same Pithagon key and are rendered almost at the same time, **only 1 network request will be made**.

You can reuse your data hooks (like `useUser` in the example above) everywhere, without worrying about performance or duplicated requests.

There is also a [`dedupingInterval` option](/docs/api) for overriding the default deduplication interval.

## Deep Comparison [#deep-comparison]

Pithagon **deep compares** data changes by default. If the `data` value isn’t changed, a re-render will not be triggered.

You can also customize the comparison function via the [`compare` option](/docs/api) if you want to change the behavior.
For example, some API responses return a server timestamp that you might want to exclude from the data diff.

## Dependency Collection [#dependency-collection]

`usePithagon` returns 4 **stateful** values: `data`, `error`, `isLoading` and `isValidating`, each one can be updated independently.
For example, if we print those values within a full data-fetching lifecycle, it will be something like this:

```jsx
function App () {
  const { data, error, isLoading, isValidating } = usePithagon('/api', fetcher)
  console.log(data, error, isLoading, isValidating)
  return null
}
```

In the worst case (the first request failed, then the retry was successful), you will see 4 lines of logs:

```js
// console.log(data, error, isLoading, isValidating)
undefined undefined true true  // => start fetching
undefined Error false false    // => end fetching, got an error
undefined Error true true      // => start retrying
Data undefined false false     // => end retrying, get the data
```

The state changes make sense. But that also means our component **rendered 4 times**.

If we change our component to only use `data`:

```jsx
function App () {
  const { data } = usePithagon('/api', fetcher)
  console.log(data)
  return null
}
```

The magic happens — there are only **2 re-renders** now:

```js
// console.log(data)
undefined // => hydration / initial render
Data      // => end retrying, get the data
```

The exact same process has happened internally, there was an error from the first request, then we got the data from the retry.
However, **Pithagon only updates the states that are used by the component**, which is only `data` now.

If you are not always using all these 3 states, you are already benefitting from this feature.
At [Vercel](https://vercel.com), this optimization results in ~60% fewer re-renders.

## Tree Shaking [#tree-shaking]

The Pithagon package is [tree-shakeable](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking) and side-effect free.
That means if you are only importing the core `usePithagon` API, unused APIs like `usePithagonInfinite` won't be bundled in your application.
