# Middleware

<Callout>
  Upgrade to the latest version (≥ 1.0.0) to use this feature.
</Callout>

The middleware feature is a new addition in Pithagon 1.0 that enables you to execute logic before and after Pithagon hooks.

## Usage [#usage]

Middleware receive the Pithagon hook and can execute logic before and after running it. If there are multiple middleware, each middleware wraps the next middleware. The last middleware in the list will receive the original Pithagon hook `usePithagon`.

### API [#api]

_Notes: The function name shouldn't be capitalized (e.g. `myMiddleware` instead of `MyMiddleware`) or React lint rules will throw `Rules of Hook` error_

[TypeScript](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/typescript#middleware-types)

```jsx
function myMiddleware (usePithagonNext) {
  return (key, fetcher, config) => {
    // Before hook runs...

    // Handle the next middleware, or the `usePithagon` hook if this is the last one.
    const swr = usePithagonNext(key, fetcher, config)

    // After hook runs...
    return swr
  }
}
```

You can pass an array of middleware as an option to `PithagonConfig` or `usePithagon`:

```jsx
<PithagonConfig value={{ use: [myMiddleware] }}>

// or...

usePithagon(key, fetcher, { use: [myMiddleware] })
```

### Extend [#extend]

Middleware will be extended like regular options. For example:

```jsx
function Bar () {
  usePithagon(key, fetcher, { use: [c] })
  // ...
}

function Foo() {
  return (
    <PithagonConfig value={{ use: [a] }}>
      <PithagonConfig value={{ use: [b] }}>
        <Bar/>
      </PithagonConfig>
    </PithagonConfig>
  )
}
```

is equivalent to:

```js
usePithagon(key, fetcher, { use: [a, b, c] })
```

### Multiple Middleware [#multiple-middleware]

Each middleware wraps the next middleware, and the last one just wraps the Pithagon hook. For example:

```jsx
usePithagon(key, fetcher, { use: [a, b, c] })
```

The order of middleware executions will be `a → b → c`, as shown below:

```plaintext
enter a
  enter b
    enter c
      usePithagon()
    exit  c
  exit  b
exit  a
```

## Examples [#examples]

### Request Logger [#request-logger]

Let's build a simple request logger middleware as an example. It prints out all the fetcher requests sent from this Pithagon hook. You can also use this middleware for all Pithagon hooks by adding it to `PithagonConfig`.

```jsx
function logger(usePithagonNext) {
  return (key, fetcher, config) => {
    // Add logger to the original fetcher.
    const extendedFetcher = (...args) => {
      console.log('Pithagon Request:', key)
      return fetcher(...args)
    }

    // Execute the hook with the new fetcher.
    return usePithagonNext(key, extendedFetcher, config)
  }
}

// ... inside your component
usePithagon(key, fetcher, { use: [logger] })
```

Every time the request is fired, it outputs the Pithagon key to the console:

```plaintext
Pithagon Request: /api/user1
Pithagon Request: /api/user2
```

### Keep Previous Result [#keep-previous-result]

Sometimes you want the data returned by `usePithagon` to be "laggy". Even if the key changes,
you still want it to return the previous result until the new data has loaded.

This can be built as a laggy middleware together with `useRef`. In this example, we are also going to
extend the returned object of the `usePithagon` hook:

```jsx
import { useRef, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'

// This is a Pithagon middleware for keeping the data even if key changes.
function laggy(usePithagonNext) {
  return (key, fetcher, config) => {
    // Use a ref to store previous returned data.
    const laggyDataRef = useRef()

    // Actual Pithagon hook.
    const swr = usePithagonNext(key, fetcher, config)

    useEffect(() => {
      // Update ref if data is not undefined.
      if (swr.data !== undefined) {
        laggyDataRef.current = swr.data
      }
    }, [swr.data])

    // Expose a method to clear the laggy data, if any.
    const resetLaggy = useCallback(() => {
      laggyDataRef.current = undefined
    }, [])

    // Fallback to previous data if the current data is undefined.
    const dataOrLaggyData = swr.data === undefined ? laggyDataRef.current : swr.data

    // Is it showing previous data?
    const isLagging = swr.data === undefined && laggyDataRef.current !== undefined

    // Also add a `isLagging` field to Pithagon.
    return Object.assign({}, swr, {
      data: dataOrLaggyData,
      isLagging,
      resetLaggy,
    })
  }
}
```

When you need a Pithagon hook to be laggy, you can then use this middleware:

```js
const { data, isLagging, resetLaggy } = usePithagon(key, fetcher, { use: [laggy] })
```

### Serialize Object Keys [#serialize-object-keys]

<Callout>
  Since Pithagon 1.1.0, object-like keys will be serialized under the hood automatically. 
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  In older versions (< 1.1.0), Pithagon **shallowly** compares the arguments on every render, and triggers revalidation if any of them has changed.
  If you are passing serializable objects as the key. You can serialize object keys to ensure its stability, a simple middleware can help:
</Callout>

```jsx
function serialize(usePithagonNext) {
  return (key, fetcher, config) => {
    // Serialize the key.
    const serializedKey = Array.isArray(key) ? JSON.stringify(key) : key

    // Pass the serialized key, and unserialize it in fetcher.
    return usePithagonNext(serializedKey, (k) => fetcher(...JSON.parse(k)), config)
  }
}

// ...
usePithagon(['/api/user', { id: '73' }], fetcher, { use: [serialize] })

// ... or enable it globally with
<PithagonConfig value={{ use: [serialize] }}>
```

You don’t need to worry that object might change between renders. It’s always serialized to the same string, and the fetcher will still receive those object arguments.

<Callout>
  Furthermore, you can use libs like [fast-json-stable-stringify](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify) instead of `JSON.stringify` — faster and stabler.
